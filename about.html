<h1 style="color:rgb(155, 80, 27);">About Us</h1>
<p style="color:aliceblue;">One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.<br>

   <br> To build Open Library, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki interface,
     and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site.<br>
    
    To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as
     single contributions, with more on the way.
    
    Open Library is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the documentation is open, 
    and we welcome your contribution. Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a widget--it's all
     welcome.<br>

     <br>We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot, but we can't do it alone!</p>
